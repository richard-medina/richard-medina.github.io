Hi there, I'm Richard MEDINA RODRIGUEZ, a mathematician interested in the analysis of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and their applications in physical and biological systems. My main research interests are :

-Kinetic theory of rarefied gases,

-Bounded domains presenting heat thermostats and their qualitative effects on the equilibrium,

-PDEs involving the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation, the Boltzmann equation, the Landau equation and the Vlasov-Poisson system. 

-Hypocoercivity theory and Krein-Rutmann-Doblin-Harris theory.



I'm currently in the position of Temporary Teaching and Research Fellow (ATER) in the MIDO departement at the Université Paris Dauphine - PSL, and I'm looking to pursue a postdoctoral position to further advance my research in the solutions of problems from statistical physics and contribute in collaborative projects. 

I did my Ph.D. at [CEREMADE, Université Paris Dauphine - PSL](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/) under the supervision of Professors [Kleber Carrapatoso](https://carrapatoso.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) and [Stéphane Mischler](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~mischler/index.html).
