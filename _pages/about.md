Hi there, I'm Richard, a mathematician interested in the analysis of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and their applications in physical and biological systems. My main research interests are :

-Kinetic theory of rarefied gases,

-Bounded domains presenting heat thermostats and their qualitative effects on the equilibrium,

-PDEs involving the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation, the Boltzmann equation, the Landau equation and the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations. 


I’m currently an ATER at the MIDO department, Université Paris Dauphine – PSL, seeking a postdoctoral position to continue my research on the mathematical problems arising from statistical physics and collaborate on interdisciplinary projects.

I did my Ph.D. at [CEREMADE, Université Paris Dauphine - PSL](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/) under the supervision of Professors [Kleber Carrapatoso](https://carrapatoso.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) and [Stéphane Mischler](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~mischler/index.html).
